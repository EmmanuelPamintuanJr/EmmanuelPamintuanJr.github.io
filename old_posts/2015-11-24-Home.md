Last week my partner and I submitted our final project 'Life'.
It was the most calm and relaxed submittal of all the projects.

Last week we talked about static variables and how declaring them changes how many instances exist at runtime. We learned that declaring a variable to be static and where you declare that variable has some interesting side effects: if you declare a variable within a class as static, it will run before main, and it will have only one instance of that variable that all will use, it will be placed on that stack, the scope does not change. However, for a global variable, declaring a variable as static makes it so that it is local only to that particular c++ page, the linker will not know about this variable and so you may have two variables  named the same in separate c++ files used globally within their respective files, so long as both are globally labelled as 'static'.

What a tricky concept, and one concept that can get yourself confused and turned over if you do not pay attention to the details.

We touched on reflection in Java. I recall my brother talking about reflection and also a coworker of mine, and how it allows for some cool things to occur, but also allows the breaking of private variables and also inability to follow what the code is doing if instances of variables rely on reflection for construction. Basically, with great power comes great responsibility and reflection in the context of java allows some great power.


pro-tip: If you are using Linux or Mac, create a shortcut to your terminal and/or become familiar with shortcuts that bring up the terminal.  Also, try making your terminal window semi-transparent, this will allow greater real estate to develop in and also allow references to be within your view as you develop.
