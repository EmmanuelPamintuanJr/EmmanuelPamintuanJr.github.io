###Tests, Tests, and Tests
![Tests](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tests.png)
--------------------------------

This past week we wrapped up material in preparation for this coming week's test.

I was called on again and I am glad that I had been participating with K.C. in writing out the methods that he had proposed on screen. That went well, I need to review how Professor Downing wrote out the methods that all the other students in class had to write out.

Professor Downing employs a "zero electronics" open in his class (except for quizes and attendance) and that has been great, there are no distractions when he is lecturing and I am enjoying that. It also forces you to focus and if anything (for some) focus on the only source of stimulus in the room, his lecture.

From prior posts, it is currently interview season and Professor Downing is excusing two interviews that require me to travel. **Note: Quizes are not excused** I personally do not want to skip class, but it is great to know that the Professor supports the necessity of securing a job.

I am a tad anxious for the test this Thursday.
My approach is to read over the list that he has provided us and to work with some of the people I know in class.

**pro-tip:** [Dual Monitors.](http://www.howtogeek.com/174452/beginner-geek-how-to-use-multiple-monitors-to-be-more-productive/)

This was something I was exposed to when I had my first internship in 2014 and it was amazing to experience how I managed my main work in the bigger monitor and the documentation and secondary software (hipchat, jira...etc.) in the secondary monitor.

Why do it?
  * Context Switching
    * Keep social media, youtube, chat, whatever is secondar here and your main work in the primary monitor
  * Documentation can be up while coding
    * In an interview that allowed it, I had java documentation up while I coded in the primary monitor

Just recently (two weeks ago) my second monitor came in (that I use as primary and my laptop as secondary) along with the stand and now I have a dual monitor setup at home.

I recommend getting a [stand](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010O1OQWM) that allows you to rotate your monitor in both landscape and portrait mode.

There is still some discussion whether people are more productive with an ultra-wide monitor or a dual-monitor setup. [link](http://lifehacker.com/ultrawide-vs-dual-monitors-which-are-better-for-produc-1695967682)
That is something worth looking into more as I feel it would matter to the individual.

I personally enjoy having two monitors as it helps me to organize all of my imporant work in the primary and any distractions in secondary and that is nice to have.

I can then fullscreen my primary which is usually an IDE and I'm good to go!

I believe this would be an investment worth your while!
