###We're Almost There Pops

-----------------------------------------------------
This past week the class was presented with 'Project Darwin'. It is an interseting project that reminds me of 'The Game of Life'.
I paired up with my friend and former co-worker, Spencer, from PayPal and we're going for the gold and attempting to knockout the entire project this weekend.
 
What is interesting about this project is the lack of use of 'setters' and 'getters'. A previous project in my information security class involed building a '[Secure System](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs361/assignment1-nonthreaded-zhao.html)' and ensuring a separation in privileges amongst all the different objects, as each object had a certain 'security level' and with that certain methods it was allowed to access.
 
It is cool to revisit this access control model as we are building a system with creatures and the creatures themselves should not be allowed to access or perform actions themselves but 'ask permission' from Darwin.
 
I am still learning C++ and with that comes some large hurdles as I am use to thinking and generating code Java-esque.
 
What is interesting is that a few days ago I woke up and in the moment between sleep and fully-awake I came to a revelation that was pretty profound to myself and my understanding of C++ : pointers are analogous to working with objects in Java, except this time we get to know where the object lives and do something with that information.

During the interview season I had to do a lot of coding challenges and there was a lot of manipulations of maps and sets and harnessing the O(1)-ness of these datastructures. The above way of viewing things came about when I thought about working with a HashMap (unordered_map in C++) of pointers and it clicked, "This is just like a a map of Objects"

This may or may not be the right way to think about it, but it sure was an 'aha!' moment.

An update on the interview adventures, I have finished all my rounds of interviewing and it is now time to make a decision on offers, and that is exciting.
I am recovering from my fatigue of travel and my mind is starting to find clarity after all the back-and-forth related to travel.

<b>Pro-Tip</b>: Become familiar with using some sort of version control, whether that is Subversion, Git, or something else.
For git, I used [GitImmersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) to learn the ropes and this site was so helpful that a TA from OS/Architecture has incorporated this site as a 
useful resource when learning git and github for the first time.

I say all this due to a cautionary tale from a colleague of mine, they recently relied on the git plugin associated with the IDE they were using and after a hard reset lost all of their work.
They were familiar with git and terminal usage, but not the plugin with the IDE which was pushed on them by a co-worker and this unfamiliarity with the plugin led to a git-meltdown.

tl;dr; Sometimes you need to fallback on what you know and not get sucked into someone else's style of doing things. It's great to learn new things
 but be careful how you tread. What works for others may not work for you and that is okay. Exposure to new tech is great, it leads to innovation, but it is not one-size-fits-all.
