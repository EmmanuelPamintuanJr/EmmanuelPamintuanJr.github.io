###The last leg

--------------------------------------

Last week saw the submission of project Darwin.
It was a very interesting project and required some planning and quite a few iterations of refactoring and retinkering in order
to get a working basic solution.

I am starting to see the fruit of writing tests first and following up with implementation.

During our classes we have been covering inheritance and understanding the difference between shallow and deep copying.
This understanding was established through writing a copy constructor for vector and implementing it so that a deep copy was made.

The quizzes have been getting me this week. They have covered the order in which constructors are called and what is actually being called under the covers. During the quizzes I am feeling lost at times, but right when the answers are discussed I follow along and I understand. That's a common mistake to fall into, not ask follow up questions on piazza and assume that seeing the answer once is enough. I will need to do just that, follow up on piazza and ask about these constructor questions.

Also, I was called on earlier last week and I once again fumbled on the answer.
I was confused as to what lines Prof. Downing was referring to, that and I was a bit slow to follow along with what Prof. Downing was talking about which then led to me being handheld through the problem. I will remember that moment, it's a good thing, as it was a discussion on how to overload the "<<" and allow a user-defined method.
