####That old-time feeling

![redundancy](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/old_files.png)

This past week went well, we are touching on pointers and references, shaky ground for a lot of us (me included).
People are answering Professor Downing's questions to the point, which is nice, it makes class run smoothly.

I have been working with my partner for the voting project and our efforts highlight pair programming and also remote working. Taking turns driving and writing out code while the other acts as reference and a scrutinizing eye creates some beautiful and working code in one pass. Practice what we preach. Preach what works. This works.

There is an incentive to work with a partner, but not an obligation.
Do not let this be a driver or a burden that makes you think you will fail if you do not get a partner, it is meant for us all to slowly break out of our "loner" shell if we have one.

(mini-pro-tip-advice-from-a-real-human-being):
If you're sheepish about finding a partner, you can find one on Piazza or you can just slowly make friends with people in class and maybe even work with a complete stranger (strictly business, get the job done).

If you're worried about meetings and times and contact information, do the following:
* share only your email/google chat
* meet only on campus in the GDC labs
* schedule things out in google calendar and stick to those meeting times and share the same document

You do not have to be their friend afterward, you do not have to hang-out afterward, you just need to work on the project.

This may sound silly to some, but these thoughts and ideas may burden someone out there, and where there is one there are others.

Interacting with people can be very stressful, especially strangers, especially when it relates to something of value. We may feel expectations of being "smart" or being a "super-star" that writes "crack code", but that really is not the case, and if someone implies it has to be, they will not get far in working with others.

Professor Downing has been great about reminding us that the option is there, but not forcing it on us like it is the only way, THE way. Kudos to him for that, it probably has allowed people to reach out and try it and see what it's like.

-------------------------------------

Pro-tip (the meat and potatoes of today's post):
People are still complaining about Tophat, no wi-fi, no laptop, not working, etc, app is not working, etc.
I feel for them, but at the same time I will just say it: <b>redundancy</b>.

It is a clear example of redundancy and resourcefulness.
<b>Be prepared in class, have back-ups, have a last resort.</b>
Treat the last resort as a<b>last resort</b>.

I worked as a consultant for 3 years and I learned this through my succcesses and failures, <b>first through failures</b>.

Let's use the Tophat Quiz as a scenario:

Planned: Use my laptop
-Bring powercord in case laptop dies

Back-up: Use my phone (smartphones with wifi,  use app, regular phones on phone reception)
-Wifi may not be working for me, reception may not be present, I may need to use the 'last resort'

...but....let's try being resourceful first...

Resourceful: Ask your friend, neighbor, someone around me if I can use their smartphone or laptop
-be prepared to explain your situation, people are sympathetic to those in need, they themselves were there

None of that worked?

Last Resort: Go up to Professor Downing, succinctly explain my situation, what I propse to do, then what I tried.

ex. "Professor Downing, I will need to write down my quiz on paper, if I may. I cannot connect to Tophat. My laptop died, I tried using my phone and got hosed, and I tried asking my neighbors if I may use a spare laptop, tablet, smartphone to sign in and it did not work out."

and most importantly....be prepared for the last resort not working.

If you've tried all you could, planned for contingencies, and tried your last resort and still no luck?
You have to accept the situation.
BUT....look back at where in the plan something did not work and you (yourself you you you you you) add it in/fix it/rectify it so next time it can be caught and you may recover with grace.

This is an example of a quiz in a class, it may seem trivial, but what if this was on a call with a client?
You were housing their data, or you had documents you were working on for them.
You planned to present/demo/deliver and there was a failure.
Do you just tell the client, "Sorry, it doesn't work/it isn't ready/I tried really hard..."?
You do not. You will lose clients and eventually lose your job.
You prepare for failure, you have backups, and you explain what you have done to recover and if nothing works, what you propose to do now.
You may still get chewed out, but everyone's been there, it happens, and there is some sympathy for you if you did your due dilligence.

We can't be prepared for everything, but we better be prepared for at least something.
