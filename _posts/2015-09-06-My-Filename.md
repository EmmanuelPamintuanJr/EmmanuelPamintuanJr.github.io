#### I have no idea what I'm doing
![xkcd](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality.png)

This past week we discussed the Collatz Project in class.

What I liked about this week:
- Professor Downing went over the Collatz Project step by step
- Professor Downing took additional time to talk about what is expected because he felt the class could use additional guidance from his gauge of the questions on Piazza
- I am liking the one-on-one attention that he is giving each student that he calls upon

Hesitations:
- The guided one-on-one questions with students had me hesitant to interrupt his flow and ask additional questions that I have on the project/topic of discussion

The above hesitation was easily remedied by asking Professor Downing my questions after class. I took note of my questions and if they were answered, I did not ask them anymore. If I needed additional elaboration or discussion on a topic, I brought them up.

###Continuous Integration.
It would be beneficial to start playing with this in your application developments and thinking about how this fits into the big picture of software development.

Look at [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/)!



pro-tip:

Sparseness in data is a theme that has been brought up in three of my classes this past week: Information Retrieval, Object Oriented Programming, and Competitive Programming (specifically DFS and BFS problems on trees)

Solutions to this observance varied for each class
Info Retrieval: Use of an inverted index
Object Oriented Programming: Use "data tiling" in your cache
Competitive Programming: Use Adjacency Lists to consolidate space

Take away?
Take the time to identify your problem as well as your constraints (Memory Space, Time Limits, Processing speeds), this will allow you to implement a solution that will save you time/sanity down the line.
