###Wait a second....

--------------------------------

Last week was our mid-term for OOP and I was somewhat anxious to see if my preparation was appropriate for the midterm. Surprisingly....it was. **gasp**

How to prepare for the OOP exam:
  * Look over the outline provided by Professor Downing
    * Implement each of the algorithms listed
      * Great reference: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/
    * Implement data structures in C++
      * Stack
      * Queue
  * Create a google doc and work with 1 or 2 people to collaborate
  * Check out Piazza and try to answer people's questions as they prepare
    * This will also help prepare yourself, if you cannot answer it, you've identified something to learn
  * Get some good sleep and do not pull an all-nighter
  * <b>Trust your gut</b>
    * If the question asked appears too simple, they probably really are that simple and that's okay

The test itself was fair and nothing on the test came as a surprise out of left or right field. Professor Downing is not trying to trick you; he is however, trying to make sure you understand the material and also see what you did to prepare. Trust your gut, there was one point where I thought to myself, "Hold on, this seems to simple, wait..." and I just trusted my gut.

The test is pure coding, and on several occassions he reiterated this, so prepare by coding.
I would also humbly advise to arrive early and sit in the middle. It was difficult to navigate to an empty seat due to everyone crowding the edges.

We received a "free-day" on the next meeting of our class section and that was great. It allowed me to catch up on other work and to also decompress from the week.

I am now confident on how to prepare for the final and knowing that is half the battle. I plan to prepare well in advance by casually "greasing the gears" and coding up the algorithms we were just tested over and also going over a few <code>const</code> and <code>&</code> and <code>*</code> problems.

pro-tip: http://www.ideone.com is a great resource. The site allows you to compile code and also to easily share your code snippets with others. This can be used also to share code with recruiters/companies to show off your coding skills by making a few programs or data structure implementations that are easily compile-able/runnable, all at the tip of their fingers.
