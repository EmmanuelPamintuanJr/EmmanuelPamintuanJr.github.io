####Setting up this blog:
This is the most frustrating thing to set-up.
For those reading things and wondering how time consuming it was to set this up for myself? It was very time consuming.

What took so long?
* Installing Ruby
* Installing Jekyll
* Following the directions provided by Jekyll to get things up and running

Thanks to someone else's post, I ended using "Jekyll-Now" to start things up and get something deployed. I am planning to reorganize things and get my tech streamlined so that I can write posts and deploy on terminal instead of writing directing within the markdown file.


####The Week of August 28th Recap
What do I like about the course:
* Professor Downing corrects people who when not being spoken to
* Professor Downing gives full attention to the people he is speaking to
* Professor Downing guides you through a question if you attempted to answer
* The course will teach you C++ from the ground up

What I am not feeling about the course (so far):
* People are spamming the hell out of Piazza to the point that it's becomming hard to navigate
  * I attribute this foolishness to:
    * People trying to achieve maximum chance of getting bonus points
    * The above
    * The above

I am excited about this class. The discussions last week taught me a lot about how to use assertions and how to also complement in-line asserts with a test-framework, like gtest, to allow the user to understand a bit more of where and why a test failed.

I am currently enrolled in the 105: Computer Programming C++ and I am forming the opinion that enrollment in that class may be entirely unnecessary.

My humble suggestion? Drop the class (C++ not OOP! :D), but sit in on the class and learn in tandem without the need to feel the pressure of turning in the course work, the coursework in OOP will already be enough.

I'm looking forward to learning new things and being asked a question!
(Hopefully I don't know the answer so I can learn by shame.)
