###The Never Tired Mind
![dreaming](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/career.png)
-----------------------
This week:

 - Turned in Allocator project
 - Talked about default functions
  - Default Functions for constructors
	- Set default functions for constructors in this case allocators
	- Implemented operators, focused on ==
	 -tightened code so that LHS and RHS both were passed into the operation


This past week we had turned in our "allocator project". It was a project that is pretty straight forward but requires a lot of pointer math.
I had written 'malloc()' in  CS429 and so this was a throwback.

Note: Start this project early and with a fresh mind. Also, make use of the '[]' overload that Prof. Downing wrote. There were a lot of posts on piazza asking how to access bytes by index and I counted at least 2 posts where Downing replied with, 'Use the [  ] that I wrote for you'. I imagine him face palming himself each time he had to write that, eventually just ctrl+c & v'ing it and choosing not to feel anything.

We had written functions that used generics but now we were discussing the use of default functions, in our specific case, defaulting
the allocator in the case the user did not define which to use for the default constructor.

We are halfway through the semester and I can definitely feel it.
I am tired from all the interviews this past month and my mind is feeling foggy.


<b>Pro-tip:</b>
Continuing from last week, <b>no idea is a bad idea</b> when it comes to development project. Keep building. Keep dreaming up stuff.

During interview sessions and info sessions, you'll hear developers talk how they solved a problem using "xyz" technology.
Take the opportunity to research into it.

I am currently exploring [Socket.io](http://socket.io/), a library that allows real-time communication.

Their "Getting Started" has two great tutorials, build a collab whiteboard and a chat room.

Give it a whirl!
