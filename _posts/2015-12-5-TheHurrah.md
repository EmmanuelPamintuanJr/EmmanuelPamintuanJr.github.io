Final post for OOP.

This past Thursday night saw the second exam for OOP and also the end of everything class related to the class.

I did enjoy the new format of the exam but I believe there should be additional safeguards in place to prevent cheating and also from people who could potentially remote in to take the test.

Theoretical Circumvention of Exam:

Method one:
- 1.) Have friend who is knowledgable of all that is OOP/C++/STL-ness sit in class with laptop and have them take the exam.
 - They would have access to the access code
 - They would run the risk of an ID check (there was no ID check in place for this test)
- 2.) Boom, test taken by someone else

Method two:
- 1.) Have a friend sit in the classroom posing as a student, the sleeper
- 2.) The sleeper transmits the access code to some chatroom/group hangout etc.
- 3.) All students who are a part of this circumvnetion would be able to take the exam remotely in the comforts of their home, library group room, anywhere

Did this happen? I don't know. 

Could this have happened? It is not outside the realm of possibilities.

Why do you think this way, Manny? Having taken quite a few security classes, and being enrolled in a classes that stresses the creation of test cases (OOP OOP OOP) I see this as an extension of all that I've learned. Also, I find it fascinating how to circumvent and break things so that I can find ways to defend.


Saying this....how would this style of test taking be hardened?

Suggestions:
 -1. Mandatory attendance taken of all students present at the exam
  - Must present student ID and be checked off the list, strict control of all who enter and leave
  - Any student who is shown to have taken the exam but not been checked off on attendance will be given a zero, no exceptions
  
 -2. No late entry to the test
  - There was a class that I took during my first degree which required being on-time or early to the exam and all students late to the class were not allowed to take the exam
  
 -3. A final question on the exam that is to be a "Safety Code"/"Validation Answer" that shows that the student who is taking the test is indeed present in the classroom
   -This would require that all students stay for the entire duration of the exam.
   -This validation/safety code would be written on the board in the last 5-10 minutes of the exam.
   -This safeguard is in place to help prevent a non-student from taking the exam remotely
   
 -4. Check the IP address of all those taking the exam, I believe Canvas logs all submission IPs
   -All students should be on the UT wifi, and all who are not (hotspot, or anything else) have no excuse to not be on UT wifi.
   
  
That's all I got for security.

The format of the answer fields would have been easier to work with had the default been set to "preformatted" as opposed to "paragraph" as the spacing and use of the TAB button were frustrating to work with.

I switched over to "preformatted" 15 minutes into the exam.

There were some issues with being able to read the prompt and answer at the same time, but a simple way around that is for a student to copy the specs into the answer and commenting the requirements out and using the specs as an outline to implement under each respective comment.



Overall the class was enjoyable, I do feel the class was C++ heavy, and I understand that to touch on some of the OOP concepts, it is necessary to have a lower level language that can touch memory and address.


I enjoyed the projects that were assigned as well as working with Travis-CI and github substantially.
I wish there were more assignments or maybe mini assignments that could be done individually.

So yes...overall.. 5 stars, would recommened to friend, verified user.


pro-tip: Don't stop learning new languages and also keep in touch with some of the people you meet in this field, they can give you new ideas, expose you to new tech, and help keep your knowledge on point.
