####What We're Learning
![lagoon](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/geography.png)

Class has picked up and we are venturing into unknown territory with generics.
Last week was the UT CNS career fair and so a majority of the students were gone this past Monday.
Professor Downing was gracious enough to not take attendance or hold a quiz.

Something that Professor Downing emphasizes time and time again is to align yourself so that you are on the right path to landing a job or internship.

So I would recommend that prospective students take this class to not only learn more about OOP but also to learn more about preparing for a career in this field.

We had a speaker on Wednesday from NASA talk to us and that was great.
It was empowering to see all the creative and innovated things that can be done within CS.

This past Thursday was the submission for project 2: Austrailian Voting.
I want to emphasize the need for attention to detail.


Pro-tip:

Particpate in at least one hackathon.
Go into the hackathon either with an original idea that you have not started, or get an idea there by trying to hack away at one of the sponsoring companies' APIs.
