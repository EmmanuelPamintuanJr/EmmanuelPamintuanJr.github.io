####What We're Learning


Class has picked up and we are venturing into unknown territory with generics.
Last weekw as also career fair and so a majority of the students were gone this past Monday.
Professor Downing was gracious enough to not take attendance or hold a quiz.
Something that Professor Downing emphasizes time and time again is to align yourself so that you are on the right path to landing a job or internship.
Take this class to not only learn more about OOP but also to learn more about preparing for a career in this field.
We had a speaker on Wednesday from NASA talk to us and that was great.


Pro-tip:

Particpate in at least one hackathon.
Go into the hackathon either with an original idea that you have not started, or get an idea there by trying to hack away at one of the sponsoring companies' APIs.

why?

   * You will learn something new
   * You will connect with awesome mentors in the tech industry
     * These mentors will give you some great tips and also may empower/inspire you to see the field a little differently
