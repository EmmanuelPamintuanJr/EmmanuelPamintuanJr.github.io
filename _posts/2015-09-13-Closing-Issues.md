Class this week was pretty vanilla.
On Friday I was called on to answer questions on the screen, it went nicely.
I am new to C++ and so it is great to see how Java parallels with C++.

In regard to the 1:1 dialogue with Prof. Downing.
When you're called on, you are given very clear directions/questions and you should reply with a very clear and plain answer.The whole purpose of being called upon is to stay engaged and allow you to have dialogue and get use to being asked technical questions but at the same time it is a time for students to learn as well.

A lesson that people will learn in life is: <b>answer the question, nothing more, nothing less</b>, if there is need for clarification, the questioner will follow up.

In other classes, one thing that grinds my gears is there is always that "one guy" that tries to act like a "hotshot" in answering/asking a question and answering more than what is asked, it throws everyone off. We're all trying to learn, not acknowledge that you're "Billy Badass".

**exhale** Back on track.....
There is no need to be nervous when you're called upon, take it as an opportunity to learn from your mistakes and have guidance. Prof. Downing will guide you if you put in your best effort to answer, and when you do not know the answer and you tried, that is aknowledged and he will teach you. That is great.



Pro-tip of the Week:


#TL;DR;
Find something you're passionate about, see if there is an API out there for it, see if you can do something cool with it that <b>YOU</b> personally would want and you're gonna make something cool. Someone else may find it useful (very likely) and if not, who cares, you learned stuff and you got a cool tool now.
-----------------------------------------


In a world where there is constantly the latest "it library" and "latest tech" to use for problem XYZ, it can be confusing where to start.
I often feel this way as I am returning for a second degree and I haven't programmed most of my life (I've been programming for ~2-2.5 years now, having started this degree in Summer 2013).

So get coding practice in what interests you!
I always wanted to know when the buses would show up and just recently Cap Metro started rolled out their own Vehicle API  [here](https://data.texas.gov/).

I used that to tinker around and lo'behold I created [ATXbusMap](http://mannypamintuan.github.io/atxbusmap) to see what I could do with the bus data. Along the way, I learned more JavaScript and sharpened what I JS experience I already had, learned more about the [google maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) and I was able to add something to my personal projects portfolio that I was genuinely proud of.

To think, this all started with tinkering around with something I am familiar with and wondering if there was an API out there for it.
