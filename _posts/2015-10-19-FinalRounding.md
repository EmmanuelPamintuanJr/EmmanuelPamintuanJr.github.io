####We're Getting there!

We received our test grades back and I survived!
I now know how to prepare and better study for the Final Exam, I am  pumped!

I was in class Monday (10/12) but I was gone the rest of last week's sessions for on-site interviews.
On Monday we covered allocators.

Let me break off into a segment of <b>"Why take this class?"</b> and relate it to my on-site interviews.....

<b>Unit tests</b>:
All of my on-site interviews not only asked me to code up a solution but after writing a solution, they asked me to write a few test cases.
- They asked what these test cases would prove.
- They asked what additional corner cases there were.
- They asked about the importance of testing

<b>Exceptions, Try, Catch</b>:
I was solving a problem in Java on the whiteboard and I asked how I should handle a certain situation, specifically if the 
method did not find the answer it was trying to, or received data that was empty. In the past, for internship interviews the interviewer
would say something along the lines of, "oh...return null..." or something along those lines. <b>Not this time.</b>

I was asked what I would do.

- throw an Exception
- put particular pieces in try,catch blocks
- use asserts

Had I not taken this class and experienced what I have experienced upto this point, I would not have been prepared for those final round interviews.
So....<b>take this class to prepare for interviews and learn the things you should have known but didn't know and it's not your fault.</b>




pro-tip: 

<b>[PLAY WITH API's!](https://apigee.com/providers?statusCode=303)</b>
Using apigee to locate and start prototyping with available APIs has been very helpful.
I used Instagram's API recently to build a webapp for an interview project: [PhotoFan](http://mannypamintuan.github.io/PhotoFan/)

The speed of development could not have been possible (I threw this together in a day or two) if Instagram had not used Apigee to be used as reference to their API.
It performs calls and displays responses.
This totally helped when it came to authentication!
It also made it easy to view the response data blob.

Check it out and develop!
